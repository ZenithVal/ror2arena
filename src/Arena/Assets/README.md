# Arena

This mod is multiplayer-only. It won't do anything in a singleplayer run.

At the end of each stage, when the Teleporter is fully charged, the following things will happen:

1. Time is frozen.
2. Artifact of Chaos is added.
3. The Teleporter and any other portals are disabled.

In order to progress the game, the players need to kill each other. The last man standing can progress the run to the next stage by using the Teleporter or any other portal. At the beginning of the next stage, everything continues normally.

**Important: this mod is currently in Alpha. There might be rough edges, run- or even game-breaking bugs. If you find any issues, please report them [here.](https://github.com/peterbozso/ror2arena/issues) You can also submit feedback and ideas there.**
